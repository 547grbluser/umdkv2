************************************* USB MegaDrive DevKit v2 **************************************

Version 2 of my USB MegaDrive DevKit. See http://vimeo.com/makestuff/umdkv2-01 for a quick tour.

Components:
    pcb          - The Nexys2-based prototype board
    vhdl         - The FPGA behavioural model.
    m68k/monitor - The UMDKv2 68000 monitor.
    m68k/testrom - Simple ROM used by unit tests (when I've got them ported).
    m68k/menu    - Placeholder for the SD-card menu ROM.
    m68k/menu    - Simple example with EclipseIDE launcher
    scripts      - Various scripts
    hackdump     - Utility for comparing memory dumps
    mkmon        - Utility for converting assembled 68k monitor to a C source file

Before you can build the project you need to build the Starscream 68000 emulator, which you can
build using the build-star.sh script.

You will also need a functional 68000 cross-assembler/compiler. You can build one using the
build-gcc.sh script; it will be installed in /usr/local/x-tools/m68k-unknown-elf. You will also
need GDB/68k, which you can build with the build-gdb.sh script; it will be installed in
/usr/local/bin. And finally there are some minor issues with the version of DDD in the Ubuntu repo;
you can build one from source with the build-ddd.sh script.
